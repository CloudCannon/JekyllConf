    <h3>Longer version</h3>

    <p>JekyllConf is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

    <p>This code of conduct applies to all JekyllConf spaces, including the online conference itself, our mailing list and our social media properties both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Organisers.</p>

    <p>Some JekyllConf spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. </p>

    <p>Harassment includes: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion </li>

      <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. </li>

      <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>

      <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>

      <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>

      <li>Threats of violence</li>

      <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>

      <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>

      <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
    </ul>
      <p>JekyllConf prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Organisers will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>

        <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>

        <li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>

        <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reporting </h3>
      <p>If you are being harassed by a member of JekyllConf, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Organisers at support@cloudcannon.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

      <p>This code of conduct applies to JekyllConf spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of JekyllConf outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by JekyllConf members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The Organisers reserve the right to exclude people from JekyllConf based on their past behavior, including behavior outside JekyllConf spaces and behavior towards people who are not in JekyllConf.</p>

      <p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

      <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of JekyllConf members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

      <h3>Consequences</h3>
      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. </p>

      <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all JekyllConf spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other JekyllConf members or the general public.</p>
